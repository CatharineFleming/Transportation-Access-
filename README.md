### Project Title: Identifying US Transit Deserts at Tract Level

Name(s) of individual or team members: Eliza Lawrence, Catharine Fleming, Anneke Brouwer

### Short 1-2 sentence summary: We mapped the level of demand and supply of public transportation in Chicago and Houston from block group Census data.

### Problem statement, question(s) and/or objective(s): 
We hope to determine if access and resources to transportation is distributed equally. This will help us figure out what areas of the city need to have public transportation expanded to meet the demand.

### Python packages that team members require: 
matplotlib, numpy, geopandas, jupyter, osmnx, networkx, census, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, contextily, shapely, gtfs_functions, gtfs_kit

### Planned methods/approach: 
Network analysis based on the methods in Assignment 3 and census variable analysis based on Activity 3.

### Expected outcomes: 
neighborhoods further from central chicago and central houston will have less accessibility to public transit
