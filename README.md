# Project Title: Mapping accessibility to public transit in Chicago, Illinois

# Name(s) of individual or team members: Eliza Lawrence

# Short 1-2 sentence summary: We plan to map distance to bus and train stops in Chicago from block group Census data.

# Problem statement, question(s) and/or objective(s): We hope to determine if access and resources to transportation is distributed equally. This will help us figure out how difficult it is for people to get to work in major cities without a car.

# Datasets you will use (with links, if available): bus stops: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Bus-Stops/hvnx-qtky

# Python packages that team members require: matplotlib, numpy, geopandas, jupyter, osmnx, networkx

# Planned methods/approach: Network analysis based on the methods in Assignment 3. We will use isochrone polygons to determine how long it takes for people to reach bus or train stations by walking.

# Expected outcomes: neighborhoods further from central chicago will have less accessibility to public transit

# Any other relevant information, images/tables, references, etc.
